# FriendFinder

Friend finder is similar to a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from your users' survey of 10 questions, then compare their answers with those from other users. The user responds to each question with a ranking of 1-5, from strongly disagree to strong agree. Then the app calculates the best match based on the absolute difference for all combined questions, and displays the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

Technology Utilized: node.express, node.js, heroku, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and J-Query.
